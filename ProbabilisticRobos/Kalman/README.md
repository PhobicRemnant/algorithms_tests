# The Kalman Filter in Probabilistic Robotics

This code is an implementation of the algorithms found in the book Probabilistic Robotics from Thrung and Burgard.

## Currently implemented:
  
  -  Linear Kalman Filter: Stored in a 1D velocity simulation, the simulation is configured for velocity simulations but acceleration is also possible. Plot shows the truth value, the meassurement and the kalman result.

## Future implementations:
  
  - Particle Filter: Popular use in robotics.
  - Extended Kalman Filter: The practical Kalman Filter, since finding Linear systems with perfect gaussian bells is improbable.
